# Host Actions

This chapter is the **host-side** companion to [Space Actions](./actions). The participant chapter explains what an Action looks like to someone who shows up to engage; this one walks you, the host, through creating and editing each Action type.

## Creating an Action

Open your Space's actions page at `/spaces/:space_id/actions` and click the **+ Create** affordance on the action carousel — the modal that opens is the entry point for every Action you'll author.

The modal asks one question first: **what kind of Action?** You pick from four tiles:

| Tile | What it makes |
|---|---|
| <svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" strokeWidth="2" strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}><polyline points="20 6 9 17 4 12"/></svg> **Poll** | A quick vote — single choice, multi-select, subjective text, or a linear scale. |
| <svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" strokeWidth="2" strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}><path d="M14 2H6a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v16a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h12a2 2 0 0 0 2-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/></svg> **Quiz** | Scored questions with a passing threshold. |
| <svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" strokeWidth="2" strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}><path d="M21 11.5a8.38 8.38 0 0 1-.9 3.8 8.5 8.5 0 0 1-7.6 4.7 8.38 8.38 0 0 1-3.8-.9L3 21l1.9-5.7a8.38 8.38 0 0 1-.9-3.8 8.5 8.5 0 0 1 4.7-7.6 8.38 8.38 0 0 1 3.8-.9h.5a8.48 8.48 0 0 1 8 8v.5z"/></svg> **Discussion** | A host prompt with rich-text replies. |
| <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/icons/users.svg')} width="16" alt="Follow" style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}} /> **Follow** | A campaign that asks participants to follow a curated set of accounts. |

Pick a tile, see a live **Preview** of the empty card on the right, then click **Create**. Ratel takes you straight to the new Action's editor URL where you fill in the rest.

> **About Meets.** The fifth Action type — **Meet** (a scheduled event with RSVP) — exists in the platform and has its own viewer at `/spaces/:space_id/actions/meets/:meet_id`, but a host editor entry point is *(Coming soon)*. Today Meets are typically created via the [MCP API](../essence/my-essence#-my-ai--my-ai) (`create_meet` tool) and then surface in the participant carousel like any other Action.

## How an editor URL works

Every Action editor lives under a stable URL pattern:

| Type | URL |
|---|---|
| Discussion | `/spaces/:space_id/actions/discussions/:discussion_id/edit` |
| Poll | `/spaces/:space_id/actions/polls/:poll_id` (admin view) |
| Quiz | `/spaces/:space_id/actions/quizzes/:quiz_id` (admin view) |
| Follow | `/spaces/:space_id/actions/follows/:follow_id` (admin view) |
| Meet | `/spaces/:space_id/actions/meets/:meet_id` (admin view) |

**Discussions have a dedicated `/edit` URL; Poll / Quiz / Follow / Meet share their URL between admin and participant views** — Ratel detects whether you're an admin and flips the page into editor mode for those four. Participants visiting the URL see the participation card; you see the editor.

Edits **autosave** with a debounce; the **Save** button in the footer flushes pending saves and fires a *Saved* toast. There is no separate "Publish" button — saving and publishing are the same gesture.

## Common Configuration

Every editor is split into a **Content** card on top and a **Configuration** card below. The Configuration card has the same set of sections across all four Action types:

| Section | What you set |
|---|---|
| **Schedule** | *Starts at* and *Ends at* date-times. Outside this window the Action isn't active. |
| **Participation & Rewards** | The reward in **Credits (CR)** drawn from the Space's [Incentive Pool](./apps#-incentive-pool-beta). Credits convert to participant points on completion. |
| **Dependency Actions** | Other Actions in the Space a participant must complete first to unlock this one. |
| **Status** | Toggle the Action between draft / live / closed. |
| **Danger zone** | Delete the Action. Submissions/responses go with it; rewards already paid are not refunded. |

Discussions add a **Moderation** section (assigning who can hide replies); Polls add a **Voting rules** section (see below).

URL: `/spaces/:space_id/actions/discussions/:discussion_id/edit`

The Content card holds:

- **Title** — what people see at the top of the discussion card.
- **Description / body** — Markdown-supported rich text. This is the prompt participants reply to.
- **Attachments** — drag-and-drop PDF / PNG / JPG up to 25 MB each.

The Configuration card adds **Moderation** alongside the common sections. Use Moderation to set who can hide off-topic replies once the discussion is live.

URL: `/spaces/:space_id/actions/polls/:poll_id`

The Content card holds:

- **Title** — the headline of the poll.
- **Questions** — between **1 and 20 questions**. Each question chooses one of four types:
  - **Single** — one option per question (radio).
  - **Multi** — multiple options selectable (checkbox).
  - **Subjective** — free-text response with an optional inline hint shown above the input.
  - **Linear** — a numeric scale with min / max bounds (1–5, 0–10, etc.).
- **Allow "Other" option** per question — adds a free-text "Other" choice next to the fixed options.

The Configuration card adds **Voting rules** alongside the common sections:

- **Allow response editing** — when on, participants can update their answers while the poll is open. Off makes responses final on submit.
- **Encrypted upload** — when on, vote results are encrypted and stored on-chain; responses cannot be edited after submission. Use this for high-stakes votes where auditability matters.

URL: `/spaces/:space_id/actions/quizzes/:quiz_id`

The Content card holds:

- **Title** and **Description** — the framing shown before participants start.
- **Questions** — between **3 and 20 questions**, each Single or Multi choice with a marked correct answer.
- **Pass Score** — minimum score (out of total questions) to clear the quiz.
- **Retry Count** — how many attempts each participant gets.
- **Survey Time** — total time allowed per attempt.
- **Attachments** — reference materials participants can consult: PDF / PNG / JPG up to 25 MB each.

Pass and the reward unlocks; fail and (if Retry Count allows) the participant can try again.

URL: `/spaces/:space_id/actions/follows/:follow_id`

The Targets card holds:

- **Title** — what the campaign is called.
- **Targets** — between **1 and 20 user accounts** the participant should follow. Each target is rendered as an inline row in the participant view with a *Follow* button right there.

The Configuration card has the common sections only — Schedule, Participation & Rewards, Dependencies, Status, Danger zone.

URL: `/spaces/:space_id/actions/meets/:meet_id` (admin view)

A scheduled event — livestream, video call, workshop, in-person gathering. The participant view at this URL is live, but a host editor entry point in the create-modal is *(Coming soon)*. Today, hosts who need a Meet can create one via the MCP API (`create_meet` tool — see [Connect via MCP](../essence/my-essence#-my-ai--my-ai)).

## Tips

- **Save your reward budget for the right Actions.** Credits come out of the Space's Incentive Pool. A Quiz for onboarding can be reward-free; the deep Discussion that anchors your final Report is where Credits earn their keep.
- **Use Dependencies to build a sequence.** A common pattern: a quick *Sample* Poll → a deep *Final* Poll. Make the Final depend on the Sample so participants warm up before the headline question.
- **Test with the participant view.** Open the same URL in a private window or a different browser session — that's exactly what your participants see. The admin / participant flip is automatic.

## What's next

- [Space Actions](./actions) — participant-side reference for the same five Action types.
- [Space Apps → Incentive Pool](./apps#-incentive-pool-beta) — fund the Credit pool your Action rewards draw from.
- [Reports](./reports) — turn the Action results into a published narrative.
